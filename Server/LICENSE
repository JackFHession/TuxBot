This license agreement ("Agreement") governs the usage and distribution of works developed by the author ("Licensor"), referred to as "Works." Any individual or entity that obtains a copy of the Works under this license is referred to as the "Licensee."

Grant of Rights:

    The Licensor grants the Licensee a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free right to obtain, use, modify, and distribute copies of the Works.

    If the Works are distributed in whole or in part, including derivative works, the Licensee must ensure that all recipients receive a copy of this license agreement along with the Works.

    Any modifications made to the Works by the Licensee must be clearly marked as such, and the Licensee must not claim or imply that their modifications are endorsed by the original Licensor.

Compatibility with GNU GPLv3:

    The Licensee may choose to distribute the Works, or derivative works based on the Works, under the terms of the GNU General Public License version 3 (GPLv3) in addition to this license.

    If the Licensee distributes the Works or derivative works under the terms of the GPLv3, they must comply with all requirements and obligations outlined in the GPLv3.

    In cases where the Licensee distributes the Works or derivative works under the GPLv3, this Free Lily License 4.1 shall act as an additional permission on top of the permissions granted by the GPLv3.

Fork Restriction:

    The Licensee is allowed to create forks (modified versions) of the original Works, provided that:
        Each fork must include a copy of this Free Lily License 4.1.
        Each fork must include a prominent link to the original Works.

Integration of Third-Party Works:

    The Licensee is allowed to integrate third-party works into the Works, subject to the following conditions:
        Each integrated third-party work must retain its original license and accompanying documentation.
        If the integrated third-party work is subject to a license that is not compatible with this Free Lily License 4.1 or the GPLv3, it must be clearly indicated, and the terms of that license must be adhered to within the scope of the integrated work.

License Agreement Modification:

    The Licensee is not allowed to modify or change the terms and conditions of this Agreement without prior written consent from the Licensor.

Disclaimer of Warranty:

    THE WORKS ARE PROVIDED "AS IS," WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED. THE LICENSOR DISCLAIMS ANY WARRANTIES, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.
